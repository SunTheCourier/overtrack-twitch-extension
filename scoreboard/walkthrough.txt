The extension displays an overlay of players and their heroes, kills, and deaths in an Overwatch competitive match.

All data is provided to the extension through pubsub (broadcasts) by the EBS.
The overlay is not interactive.

The provided review channel has a looped video of a competitive game, along with the EBS providing the relevant events for that video updating the overlay.
If you happen to tune in as the match starts or ends the extension may have hidden itself, just wait a little bit for the game to (re)start and the overlay to become active - I've tried to trim the video to minimize this time.
